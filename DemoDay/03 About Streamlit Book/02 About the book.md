# About the library

## Where can I find it?
The repository is online at https://github.com/sebastiandres/streamlit_book

## How does it works?
* It will read the alphabetical order of the python and markdown files of the given path.
* It will read and render the files into streamlit, allowing a enriched markdown for pedagogical activities.

## Why is it interesting?

Because a teacher does not need to (necesarily) know about streamlit to create a streamlit book.
It only needs to create a folder structure and edit markdown files.
Buuuut, it can add streamlit interactive apps, activities and quizzes!
