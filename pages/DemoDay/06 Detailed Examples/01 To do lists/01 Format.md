# Markdown Format - Activities

There is a standard format for todo list. 
We will use the custom header `stb.to_do_list` to let streamlit_book it needs to convert it from markdown to streamlit components.

The `- [x] ` is used to denote a completed task, while `- [ ] ` is used to denote a task to be done.

```
stb.to_do
[Optional] Description:
- [x] task 1
- [ ] task 1
- [ ] task 3
```
